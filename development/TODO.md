# Monolith TODO

Source of truth for design: `docs/README.md`. Phases: `docs/20-roadmap.md`.

## Done — Analysis phase

- [x] Clone and study PocketBase v0.40.6 source (commit `7f2773ec`)
- [x] Teardown of PocketBase: DB setup, write/read path, rules, realtime, auth (`docs/01`)
- [x] Bottleneck list B1–B23 with Monolith fixes (`docs/02`)
- [x] Architecture: control/data plane, thread model, group commit, change bus (`docs/03`)
- [x] DB engine evaluation: SQLite vs Postgres vs Turso vs KV vs DuckDB (`docs/04`)
- [x] Data model, IDs, field types, change log, migrations (`docs/05`)
- [x] Rules engine design (`docs/06`)
- [x] Realtime design (`docs/07`)
- [x] Auth, tokens, API keys (`docs/08`)
- [x] Sync protocol and backup (`docs/09`)
- [x] Analytics (`docs/10`)
- [x] API surface, OpenAPI, MCP (`docs/11`)
- [x] SDKs and integration modes (`docs/12`)
- [x] Files, extensibility, admin UI framework choice (SolidJS) (`docs/13`–`15`)
- [x] Performance engineering and benchmark plan (`docs/16`, `17`)
- [x] Deployment, security, roadmap (`docs/18`–`20`)
- [x] Root `CLAUDE.md`
- [x] Repository structure: `api/` contract, `docs/` user API docs, `sdks/` (npm, Android/Kotlin, Dart, Swift, Python, Rust) (`docs/21`)
- [x] Common JS/TS project setup with pnpm workspaces (`ui/`, `sdks/typescript/`, `examples/web-typescript/`)

## Blocked on owner answers (`docs/20` open questions)

- [ ] Q1: Client stacks of your first apps (Flutter / native Android / web) → SDK priority
- [ ] Q2: Production hardware (vCPU, RAM, ARM vs x86)
- [ ] Q3: Durability default (`synchronous=NORMAL` vs `FULL`)
- [ ] Q4: Per-app admins in v1?
- [ ] Q5: Private use only, or public multi-tenant later?

## Next — Phase 0 (spikes and bake-off)

- [ ] Create Cargo workspace skeleton + `rust-toolchain.toml`, CI (fmt, clippy, test, deny)
- [ ] Create `bench/` harness (oha already installed; custom Rust harness for realtime/sync)
- [ ] PocketBase baseline P1–P7 in Docker (ask before running on host) — validates B1–B10
- [ ] `AppStore` trait + SQLite prototype: writer thread, group commit, reader pool
- [ ] Postgres co-located prototype over Unix socket
- [ ] Verify Turso MVCC maturity (Q-engine); include only if usable
- [ ] Micro-benchmarks: JSON row writer vs `serde_json`/`sonic-rs`, UUIDv7 BLOB, `WITHOUT ROWID` vs rowid, page size, mimalloc vs jemalloc
- [ ] Analytics bake-off A1–A3: DuckDB vs SQLite rollups
- [ ] Docker image: musl vs glibc, DuckDB static link feasibility
- [ ] Mark ADR-001 (`docs/04`) Accepted with measured numbers; revise `docs/16` budgets

## Later phases (see `docs/20-roadmap.md`)

- [ ] Phase 1: core data plane (apps, collections, rules compiler, records REST, change log, admin UI v0)
- [x] Agent skills pack scaffold (`agent-skills/`) and debug-surface design (`docs/22`)
- [ ] Build `tools/agent-pack` generator + `monolith agent-init` CLI; serve `/llms.txt`, `/agent/*`
- [ ] Implement debug endpoints (trace, rules:explain, query:explain, realtime inspect, sync status, dry_run) in Phase 1–2
- [ ] Fill `api/openapi` + `api/asyncapi` + conformance vectors (contract first)
- [ ] Phase 2: auth, API keys, realtime, rate limiting, TS + Dart SDK v0
- [ ] Phase 3: sync, files, backups, pilot app
- [ ] Phase 4: OpenAPI + MCP, analytics, webhooks, WASM plugins, full admin UI
- [ ] Phase 5: PocketBase importer, Kotlin/Swift SDKs, passkeys, replicas
